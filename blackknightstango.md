# Black Knights Tango
- The Black Knights' Tango (also known as the Mexican Defense, Two Knights' Tango or Kevitz-Trajkovic Defense) is a chess opening beginning with the moves: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 Nc6. This position can also be reached by transposition, for example 1.c4 Nf6, 1.d4 Nc6, or 1.c4 Nc6.

- Then, if you don't play e6 and d5, your knights will be chased as white continues developing pieces and dominating the board. The best black can do in that setup IMO is 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 Nc6 3.Nf3 e6 4.a3 d5 5.Nc3/e3 which is some sort of Queen's Gambit Declined, only better for white than the normal one.
