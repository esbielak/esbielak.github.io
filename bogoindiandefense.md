# Bogo Indian Defense
- The theory behind the Bogo-Indian Defense is based on hypermodern principles: instead of occupying the center immediately with pawns, Black aims to control it from a distance with minor pieces and undermine White's center. The strategy entails an early check to the white king, which can disrupt White's plans of smooth development. ...

- The Bogo-Indian Defence is named after the Russian-born German master Efim Bogoljubow who is believed to have originated the opening and played it regularly in the 1920s. Subsequent prominent players to have adopted the Bogo-Indian include Aron Nimzowitsch, Paul Keres, Tigran Petrosian, Bent Larsen, Vasily Smyslov, Viktor Korchnoi, Ulf Andersson, Michael Adams and Nikita Vitiugov.
